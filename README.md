# Computation of the Biot-Savart line integral
A comparison of different methods for computing the Biot-Savart line integral over a 1D current-carrying curve. This code is for the paper ``Computation of the Biot-Savart line integral" (https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.12522). Here, we include the code used to produce the plots shown in the paper.
